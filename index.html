    <!-- This is the second question-->
    <p>
      I read a paper titled “Gender stereotypes and academic performance: the influence of salient
      role models on stereotype validation”. The paper talks about how people in general feel the
      need to have a role model as a north star, especially when these models have proven track
      record of success in related fields. From the paper I was able to broaden my horizon on the
      issue of negative stereotype. I was exposed to how prejudice against women as regards
      intellectual capabilities could in fact fuel the paradigm of incompetence, which in turn makes
      a woman feel as though she can’t excel in certain professional fields especially the ones that
      are male dominated. The paper went on to speak about the existence of social narratives
      backing these false claims which in the end leads to a woman becoming more and more
      complaisant to(with maybe??) failure, not trusting in her own abilities and ultimately fitting
      into the status quo. Another part of the research that enthralled me was how gender specific
      role models could have a direct impact on competence, it spoke about how women tend to be more
      optimistic if the path they have chosen has been conquered be a fellow woman, it was stated in
      the paper that a female role model who has been able to succeed in a male domain is critical
      as evidence against negative stereotypes ultimately resulting in a higher sense of self-worth
      for aspiring women. The research then went on to give detailed analysis that proved the thesis
      and I must say that going through the research was a really enlightening experience for me.

    <p>
      In the course of completing the 9<sup>th</sup> question, i made a text <b>bold</b> then i went
      on to make a text <strong>important</strong>. I also <i>made a text italic</i> then i
      <em>emphasized a text</em> made another text <s>marked out </s>, the part about
      <small> text smaller</small> was confusing at first but i did it. I
      <del> made a this text</del> and made an <ins>inserted</ins> text and finally i
      <sub>made a Superscript</sub>. It was a really fun experience.
